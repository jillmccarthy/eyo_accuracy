# How accurate is the estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) in FTD?

EYO is a commonly used measure of symptom onset in individuals who are genetically at risk of developing a certain disease. It is calculated as the mean age of onset in an individual's family members subtracted from the individual's age. For example, a 60 year old individual who's family member's mean age of onset was 80 years old will have an EYO of -20, meaning they are 20 years away from their estimated age of onset. EYO is an imprecise measure at best, but better alternatives do not currently exist.

For my PhD research, I investigated MRI changes in individuals who carry gene mutations causing frontotemporal dementia, including both those who were currently symptomatic and those who had not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic). A part of this research, I used EYO as a measure of how close the presymptomatic participants were to symptom onset. But I wondered, how accurate is this measure in my dataset? So I decided look at the accuracy of the EYO in the symptomatic participants by comparing their estimated age of onset with their observed age of onset.
